              Alpha Orbital is primarily an info site covering the news around Elite: Dangerous, EvE
              Online, X universe and their future updates. Along with fresh info about the games,
              you can also find a full showcase of ships currently available with the appropriate
              info displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, the Ship Comparison Tool enables you to compare various stats of any ship ingame
              varying from small to extra large sizes. I'd also like to take this opportunity to
              thank everyone who helped by submitting the data needed and giving their screenshots
              for the SCT, especially Sparky Corp, Earth Ultimatum IV, Aken_Bosch, and awesome
              people at Egosoft without whom this whole thing wouldn't be possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Have in mind that keeping track of so many stats can get a bit messy... So, if you run
              across any site errors, wrong stats, images, or data in general - please, let me know
              either via <a href="mailto:skipp@alpha-orbital.com">e-mail</a> or through
              <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/skipp86/">Steam</a>.

              The general idea behind Alpha Orbital originated somewhere in December 2015. When
              you're a gamer that has some spare time, and you like to keep yourself busy with web
              development - your mind tends to come up with some pretty random ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of which was a simple ship comparison tool that I did a while back for Elite:
              Dangerous (the original SCT didn't contain ship showcases), so the logical step would
              be to take everything I learned from that project and crank it up a notch. :)
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few initial conversations with some X players on Steam, it turned out that
              there were no real info sites for X: Rebirth that were up to date. With even the
              official site having limited info on the game, Alpha Orbital started to form...
